This test document shows an example of retrieving previously deleted images, 
accepted comments, and accepted suggestions.  The saved PDF of each revision is 
included.  In 1-42, the suggestion has been accepted and added to the text of 
the file. Revision 43 deletes everything in the file, so 1-43 appears to be a
blank page, but the comments, suggestions, and images are retrievable.  

Any deleted comments have their content stripped, so only the accepted or 
current comments are visible.
