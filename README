config/ must be set up with your application's credentials (client id, client secret) in order to
authorize access to your google account through API for gdocsFx.py.  Other files require google
changelogs or output from log2csv.py

Use gdocsFx without any arguments to retrieve either a slide or presentation file log from
the google drive account associated with your config information.  The plain text, images, comments,
and suggestions are output to a directory.  Deleted images are also shown.  gdocsFX uses the other
scripts log2csv, csv2plain, and slide2plain.

log2csv.py takes a google changelog and outputs a flat version with key translations provided by mappings.py.
log2csv output can be used by csv2plain to extract plain text.

csv2plain takes output from log2csv in order to generate all plain text from the file.

slide2plain takes a google changelog from a slides file and outputs the images +plain text for each
box contained in each slide in a specified directory.  Each slide is output to a separate folder, with
each text box contained in that slide a separate text file.
